# Discord-Merge-Titlebar
CSS for discord that merges the titlebar to save space and also fixes the misaligned message bar.

### Installation
Tested with Vesktop v1.5.8, Fedora 42 & Gnome 48 on 3.Sep.2025.

Simply apply the css to your discord client.
In Vesktop you can paste the code into QuickCSS or paste the style.css file into .config/vesktop/themes and enable it within themes. Also make sure to enable Discord Titlebar under Vesktop Settings.

### Limitations
- No window decorations in settings
- Dragging the window by grabbing the titlebar doesn't work when you are in Discord Shop.
